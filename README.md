# Twitter

A "full" Twitter clone recreated with Phở Networks

The difference of the Twitter recipe from [Basic](https://github.com/pho-recipes/Basic) is:

1. The generic name of Graph.pgql is renamed as Twitter.pgql 
2. The generic name of Status.pgql is renamed as Tweet.pgql
3. Private messaging incorporated with the Message.pgql edge.
